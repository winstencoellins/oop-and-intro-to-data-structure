# Week 4 Assignment

You will be implementing a super simple binary tree function code which are `insert` and `search`.

## Steps

Download the `Node.java` and `BinaryTree.java` files and store it in your working folder or directory. Read the instruction carefully, and implement the code. `Tester` code will
be provided by us. As an addition, for your own sake of knowledge, remember to read about the `Sorting Algorithm` that we had discussed `Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Selection
Sort`. Goodluck!
