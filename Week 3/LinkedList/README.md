# Week 3 Linked List Assignment
In this assignment, you will be provided with the Node.java class and LinkedListInterface.java interface to help you in the assignment. Your assignment will be to complete a class with the name LinkedList.java that implements LinkedListInterface.java. 

## Steps
Download the Node.java,LinkedListInterface.java, and LinkedList.java files or you can copy and paste the content of the files to new files if you choose to create new files. Review the contents of Node.java class to understand the behavior of the class. You may also experiment using the class on your own before proceeding to the next step.

Next, review the contents of LinkedListInterface.java and make sure you read and understand all the functionality provided. We recommend you to implement the methods in the order provided in the interface as they increase in difficulty and being able to implement the earlier methods will help you in implementing the next methods. 

We have provided the skeleton code for your LinkedList.java class. You will then complete the "TO DO" section of the LinkedList.java class.

### Attributes and Constructors
The LinkedList.java class has 2 attributes which are `head` and `size`. The head will store the address of the first node in the Linked List and size will represent the number of nodes in the list. Next, you will implement the constructors of the class. One of the constructor will contain no argument while the other constructor will contain one argument.
